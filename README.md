# lazEnum

### Description
lazEnum is a target enumerator for the lazy hacker. When you give lazEnum a target IP or URL, it will do any DNS resolution necessary, check the IP's reachability, do a port
scan to see what ports are open, then go into further enumeration tactics depending on the type of port that is open. This is still a massive work in progress so no judging.

### Logic Map

$ python ./lazEnum.py [ip/url]
